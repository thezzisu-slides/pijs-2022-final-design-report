# What is ChiJS?

<br>

ChiJS is a framwork to bring **Developer Oriented Tools** to **General Users**.

Specifically, we provide:

- Low-overhead and fully-typed **RPC implementation**
- Context-isolated and loosely coupled **Plugin system**
- Modern, extendable and reusable **GUI**
- Novel user-interactable and composable **Actions and Tasks**

  background-size: 100%;

# Background

### JavaScript ecosystem: the Plugin problem

- Lot's of JS framworks supports 'plugin' to make them extendable
- How to implement the plugin function?
  - Load plugin (JS module or function) into main program
  - Use events/hooks to inject specific code into execution flow and change origin behavior
  - Example:
    - Express, Fastify
    - Webpack, Vite
    - KoishiJS

# The Plugin problem

- Q: How to share functions between plugins?
- To this question, some framworks has given their best practice
- Example: [KoishiJS Service](https://koishi.js.org/guide/plugin/service.html#%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E7%9A%84%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F)
- The core concept here is **D**ependency **I**njection or **I**nverse **o**f **C**ontrol
- Plugin inject custom property to (somehow) global objects, then other plugins could use them
- Typing is archived using TypeScript declartion merging
- However, there're still more problems:
  - ü§Ø Plugin side-effects
  - ü§î Same plugin, multiple instance
  - üòÇ One crash, all crash
