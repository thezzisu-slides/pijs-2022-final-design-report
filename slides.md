# What is ChiJS?

<br>

ChiJS is a **meta framwork** to bring **Developer Oriented Tools** to **General Users**.

Specifically, we provide:

- Low-overhead and fully-typed **RPC implementation**
- Context-isolated and loosely coupled **Plugin system**
- Modern, extendable and reusable **GUI**
- Novel user-interactable and composable **Actions** and **Units**

# Background
## JavaScript ecosystem: the Type problem

- Normally, when using TypeScript, we just need to import desired variables which are narually typed

```ts
// add.ts
export async function add(a: number, b: number): number {}
// main.ts
import { add } from './add.js'
```

- But in some scenario, we need to indirectly/remotely use a function or variable, which couldn't be archived through `import`
- Suppose we have a RESTful service `adder` which provides a single method `add`
```ts
// service.ts
export async function add(a: number, b: number): number {}
registerEndpoint(add)
// client.ts
const client = new Client('http://localhost:3000')
const c = await client.add(1, 2) // <- How to automatically type this?
```


---

# The Type Problem
- Solution 1: Code generator
- Since we have access to the whole code...
- We can analysis the service code (or the running service), then generate client code!
- Examples: [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) and [ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- Pros:
  - Intuitive
  - Not limited to the JavaScript world
  - Flexible
- Cons:
  - ü§Ø Analyzing JavaScript code is really, super, exterme **HARD**
  - üò¢ Typings are **complex** as they may dependes on other types
  - Thus, we need to write **schemas** for APIs which brings duplication of work


---

# The Type Problem
## Code generator pseudo code
```ts
async function add(a: number, b: number): number {}
const schema = {
  props: [
    { type: 'number' },
    { type: 'number' }
  ],
  returns: {
    type: 'number'
  }
}
registerEndpoint(schema, add)
```
- Not DRY
- Requires additional checks on schema and type consistency


---

# The Type Problem
- Solution 2: type injection and type calculation
- Use `import type` to prevent TypeScript generating real import statements
- Or use `declartion merging` to globally inject types
- Use type functions to transform types
- Pros:
  - No need to generate code - avoids lots of problems!
  - Complex types are supported
- Cons:
  - Dependency problem
    - We just need the type, not the implementation!
  - Requires some TS tricks


---

# The Type Problem
## import type pseudo code
```ts
// service.ts
export async function add(a: number, b: number): number {}
registerEndpoint(add)
// client.ts
import type { add } from './service.js'
const client = new Client<{add: add}>('https://localhost:3000')
const result = await client.add(1, 2)
```


---

# The Type Problem
## global injection pseudo code
```ts
// plugin.ts
type SelfDescriptor = PluginTypeDescriptor<{ foo(bar: string): number }>
declare module '@chijs/core' {
  interface IPluginDescriptors {
    '~/plugin.ts': SelfDescriptor
  }
}
new PluginBuilder<SelfDescriptor>().build((ctx) => {
	endpoint.provide('foo', (bar) => +bar) // Type checked!
})
// another-plugin.ts
...
const proxy = await ctx.getServiceProxy<DescriptorOf<'~/plugin.ts'>>('some-service')
const result = proxy.foo('123') // 123
```

---

# The Type Problem

- Based on this idea, we implemented a package `@chijs/rpc` to provide a **typed** and **low overhead** generic RPC module, which provides:

  - remote function invocation
  - publish / subscribe
  
  and requires only a reliable connection eg. WebSocket / Node.JS IPC


---

# Background
## JavaScript ecosystem: the Plugin problem

- Lot's of JS framworks supports 'plugin' to make them extendable
- How to implement the plugin function?
  - Load plugin (JS module or simply a function) into main program
  - Use events/hooks to inject specific code into execution flow and change origin behavior
  - Example:
    - Express, Fastify
    - Webpack, Vite
    - KoishiJS
- In this slide, we call this implementation method `module based plugins`


---

# The Plugin problem
## Module based plugins
- Q: How to share functions between plugins?
- To this question, some framworks has given their best practice
- Example: [KoishiJS Service](https://koishi.js.org/guide/plugin/service.html#%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E7%9A%84%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E5%91%A8%E6%9C%9F)
- The core concept here is **D**ependency **I**njection or **I**nverse **o**f **C**ontrol
- Plugin inject custom property to (somehow) global objects, then other plugins could use them
- Typing is archived using TypeScript declartion merging


---

# The Plugin problem
## Module based plugins
- Pros:
  - Easy to implement
  - Fast since all code are running in the same process & v8 instance
  - Enjoy full JavaScript magics
- Cons:
  - ü§Ø Plugin side-effects
    - Example: two plugins use `dotenv` to inject a **same** env key
  - üòÇ One crash, all crash
    - Example: one plugin uses FFI to call native function and causes the whole node.js process to crash


---

# The Plugin problem

- However, there are other ways to implement plugins
- We could load plugins into separate processes and communicate with them using IPC
- Example: [VSCode extension host](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/extension-host)
- In this slide, we call this implementation method `process based plugins`


---

# The Plugin problem
## Process based plugins
- Props:
  - üòã No side-effects: Easy to implement **H**ot **M**odule **R**eloading
  - üòé Plugin crash will not affect other parts of the program
- Cons:
  - Performance is not as good as module based plugins
    - IPC requires resources
  - Communication between plugins must be serializable
    - IPC requires serialization
  - Hard to support typings


---

# The Plugin problem
- In ChiJS, we implemented a **process based** plugin system
- Typeing is archived using **type injection** and **type computation**
- RPC is fully supported based on `@chijs/rpc`


---

# Background
## JavaScript ecosystem: the UI problem

- To write a GUI or not to write, that is the question
- A few months ago, I write JS code for 5min to implement a AC remote, but spent more then 5hr on turning it into a SPA üòÇ
- Is there a way to implement basic user interaction without wasting time on GUI?

---

# The UI Problem

- Basic user interaction can be abstracted into a interface with set of methods like
  - alert
  - prompt
  - ...
- User agent is just a component that implements this interface
- We just need to invoke those methods
- If user agent and our code are running in different context, then use RPC to archive it
- By abstracting basic user interactions, we could split the implementation of the frontend and the caller
- Then, we get the ability to implement frontend in **different ways** like WebUI, CLI or even programmatically interact with caller code

---

# The UI Problem

- In chijs, this problem is solved by defining a special RPC Descriptor called `Agent`
- Our frontend implements a RPCEndpoint for Agent
- RPCHandler of Agent is injected into Actions' context
- Then, there's interactable actionsüòã

# Introduction
Expected usages

ChiJS Framwork is capable for
- Wrap programs into services (a bit like systemd lol)
- Wrap scripts into composable actions
- Wrap other framworks/tools into a application running as a web app or desktop app
- ...

Which let you
- say goodbye to command line and do things by just clicks
- expand potential users by lowering barriers to use your tool
- run scripts in background without black windows
- ...


---

# Introduction
Expected usages

And for me, I develop ChiJS for
- Desktop automation
- Daemonlize tools including `serve` and `koishi` with a consistent interface
- Share useful scripts with my friends
- Manage Node.JS processes on my server cluster

However, as a generic framwork, ChiJS have more possibilities subject to use

# Introduction
Project structure

Each package is inside `/packages/<PKGNAME>`

Run `yarn build` at repo root will build all packages by their topo-order, which is required for development

The following slides will brief on those packages
